# About this project 
This project exemplifies how deep learning can be applied to niche areas like toy classification, showcasing both technical skills in machine learning and a passion for creativity through LEGO. Whether you're a fellow developer, a LEGO enthusiast, or simply curious about AI applications, this project offers valuable insights into the intersection of technology and play.

## Project Description

This project features a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** that classifies LEGO bricks into **16 different categories**. The model is designed to facilitate applications in **automated sorting** and **inventory management**, making it easier for users to organize and utilize their LEGO collections effectively. By leveraging advanced image recognition techniques, this CNN not only enhances the sorting process but also opens up possibilities for more efficient inventory tracking and management in various contexts.
